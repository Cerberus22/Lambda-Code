# Contributing to Swirl

Thanks for contributing to Swirl. We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

## All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. Do not make a pull request for adding a stuff which is incomplete or if you have not changed anything major in the source. If there are typos in identifiers or in strings, do NOT make PR's but create an issue to inform us instead. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code is readable.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the GPL v3.0 License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GPL v3.0 License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/LC-Lang/Lambda-Code/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by choosing a issue template [here](https://github.com/LC-Lang/Lambda-Code/issues/new/choose). it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

-   A quick summary and/or background
-   Steps to reproduce
    -   Be specific!
    -   Give sample code if you can. Code that _anyone_ can run to reproduce what you were seeing.
-   What you expected would happen
-   What actually happens
-   Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People _love_ thorough bug reports.
