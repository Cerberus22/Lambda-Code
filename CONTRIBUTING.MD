# Contributing to Lambda Code
Thanks for contributing to Lambda Code. We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code is readable.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the GPL v2.0 License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GPL v2.0 License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-2.0/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/Lambda-Code-Organization/Lambda-Code/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by choosing a issue template [here](https://github.com/Lambda-Code-Organization/Lambda-Code/issues/new/choose). it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. Code that *anyone* can run to reproduce what you were seeing
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* 4 spaces for indentation rather than tabs if your PR has the python language
* You can try the formatter of the python extension of vscode
