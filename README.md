# Lambda Code

Lambda code is a new high level compiled staticly typed programming language. Written in python, C, C++. Its [syntax](syntax.md) is far more easier then other high level compiled languages. like cpp for example.

### Lambda Code
```lc
func name:void()
  print("Hello world")
endfunc
```
### C++
```cpp
#include<iostream>

using namespace std;
 
int main()
{
    cout<<"Hello World";     
    return 0;
}
```

The language will have its own GUI library for making desktop apps, a web framework for making dynamic websites etc.

The language is still in heavy development. There are lots of work that needs to be done.

## contributing
Contributions to the language are appreciated. We want to work in a open source community. If you want to contribute to the language you can make a pull request. We will review it. And if we think its good enough to take, we will merge it in our language.

## Issues and feature request
