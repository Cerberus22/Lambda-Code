# Lambda Code

Lambda code is a new high level, compiled, statically typed, object-oriented programming language.

### Hello World!
```
print("Hello world!")
```

check the [specification](specification.md) for more details

The language WILL have its own GUI library for making cross-platform desktop apps, a web framework for making dynamic websites etc.

The language is still in heavy development. There are lots of work that needs to be done. We are expecting to release the first beta if not stable version in August this year.
